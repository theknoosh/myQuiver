Thought it was no big deal and attempted to delete it, which of course crashed xcode over and over again. So I manually deleted the file, and deleted the reference to it in the project. Then I got a warning from Xcode that the file was missing which I could not get rid of. Fortunately, I had a time machine backup done just 40 minutes earlier which I restored. Lost 40 minutes of work, but could have been much worse."
