Today the tv went out in the living room, so my wife is spending time in our bedroom where I can’t go. This leaves me with hours alone.</div><div><br></div><div>I keep telling myself that this is temporary and how lucky I am as this could be much much worse. But still I am very unhappy about my situation, and two more months of this seems like an eternity.</div><div><br></div><div>I sleep very badly because I have to sleep on my back as I can’t turn over. I’m spending more and more time in a wheel chair, which I don’t care much for either. But that’s the breaks I guess.</div>"
