Can’t put a finger on why, just did not feel up to it. Daily struggle to handle depression, even when things are going fairly well. Had to deal with Stephanie’s usual nasty remarks, but that is just the way she is, and I guess I will have to deal with it as I have for the last 38 years.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Sitting in the car with my laptop, got wifi from the gym, so plan to do a little coding on said wife’s web site. Going back through the SASS class I already took on lynda.com (could not remember any of it). This time I am documenting the process so maybe I can use what I have learned on my own projects this time.</div>"
